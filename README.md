# Auction

This code creates two variables: bids and bidding. bids is a dictionary that will store the names of the bidders and their bids. bidding is a Boolean variable that indicates whether or not the bidding is currently open. Then it defines a function called find_highest_bidder. This function takes one argument, which is a dictionary of bidders and their bids. The function works by first finding the highest bid in the dictionary. It then finds the bidder who made that bid and prints their name and bid amount.

Then we have a a loop that will continue to run as long as bidding is equal to False. Inside the loop, the code will ask the user for their name and bid amount. It will then store the user's name and bid amount in the bids dictionary. Finally, the code will ask the user if there are any other bidders. If the user types n, the loop will break and the code will call the find_highest_bidder function to find the winner of the auction.
